Description: This package helps to generate LaTeX code for drawing well-formatted neural network diagrams. Users have to define number of neurons on each layer, and optionally define neuron connections they would like to keep or omit, layers they consider to be oversized and neurons they would like to draw with lighter color, as well as title of diagram, color of lines, opacity of lines, labels of layers, input and output neurons. Also, this package helps to produce LaTeX code for drawing activation functions which are crucial in neural network analysis. To make the code work in a LaTeX editor, users need to install and import some TeX packages in the setting of TeX file.
