This package helps to produce LaTeX code for drawing well-formatted neural network diagrams. Users have to define number of neurons on each layer, and optionally define neuron connections they would like to keep or omit, as well as title of diagram, color of lines, opacity of lines, labels of layers, input and output neurons. To make the code work in a LaTeX editor, users also need to install and import two TeX packages in the setting of TeX file.
